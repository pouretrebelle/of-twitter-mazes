# Twitter Maze Bot in openFrameworks

## Setup

To compile it needs to be inside the `myApps` folder of your openFrameworks installation. Built with MS Visual Studio but can be replicated in a fresh XCode project (created by the project generator) by copying the `src` folder.

## Concept

I wanted to make a maze bot that can only be interacted with by tweeting it. Unfortunately I failed to achieve that goal due to difficulty with the oF addons that were necessary to that functionality. At present you can interact with the mazes using the arrow keys on the keyboard.
