# Twitter Maze Bot in openFrameworks

This program algorithmically generates mazes and can be interacted with through twitter.

When running, [@mazingbot](https://twitter.com/mazingbot) tweets an image of a maze and tracks replies. If a reply contains one or more directions (`left`/`l`, `right`/`r`, `up`/`u`, `down`/`d`) it moves the current pointer accordingly, creating a trail in the user's profile link colour, and replies with an image of the updated maze path. When complete it makes a thank you tweet mentioning all the contributors, and tweets out a fresh maze. The cycle begins again.

## Setup

To compile it needs to be inside the `myApps` folder of your openFrameworks installation. Built with MS Visual Studio but can be replicated in a fresh XCode project (created by the project generator) by copying the `src` folder. It requires the [ofxOsc](https://github.com/openframeworks/openFrameworks/tree/master/addons/ofxOsc) addon which should be added through the project generator.

This project uses a lightweight node app to communicate with Twitter, sending data to openFrameworks over OSC. The openFrameworks program must be started before the node app. It requires [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) to install dependencies.

To run you must clone the `node-src/.env-example`, rename it to `.env` and fill in with Twitter access keys and tokens which can be generated by [registering an app](https://apps.twitter.com/).

```
cd node-src
npm install
npm start
```
